Shell Hacks: Git

This week we'll present some advanced git features, as well as explore higher level patterns of use that can turn git into a streamlined part of your development process. The workshop should address scenarios you may have already found your self in:

  - (insert favorite profanity here), that last commit wasn't quite right.
  - Merge conflicts...
  - I want to explore an alternative to the most recent changes in my working directory without throwing them out.
  - I've lost track of what's happened in the last couple hours of coding.
  - Something about my most recent changes no longer works. What could it be?
  - How do I work cleanly with other developers?
  - What should be committed, what should be ignored, why?

We'll prompt you to think about your own experience with git, and discover the workflow that works for you.

Git Foundations

The first hour will be dedicated to your personal challenges and interests. Vincent and Allon will be available to offer their guidance on whatever aspect of development you are facing.

> git add .
> git commit -m 'stuff'
> # we can do better than that...

Hour number two will be dedicated to mastering git through foundational understanding and good habit. We'll be looking at how git is best used individually and collaboratively to prepare you for coding in a professional environment.
