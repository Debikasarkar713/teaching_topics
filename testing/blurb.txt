Testing

You know that feeling when you make no coding mistakes ever, and every one you
code with is perfect? Me Neither. This week we'll be showing you how to design
and write effective tests. In the words of Donald Knuth, "Beware of bugs in the
above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it." Tests are our way of
trying the code.

We'll also provide an opportunity to work through obstacles in your personal
projects.
